# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

This log is intentionally written as an engineering record rather than a launch theater timeline. Dates reflect when the concept, design, prototype, and public packaging phases were mature enough to document.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-12

### Released
- Published **workflow-orchestration-studio** as a public, portfolio-grade identity governance system.
- Packaged the current implementation, documentation, validation workflow, and proof surfaces into a repo that could be reviewed by engineering, product, and operating stakeholders.
- Tightened the repo story around the real-world operating problem: identity sprawl, tenant-boundary risk, and access-review friction.

### Why this mattered
- Existing approaches in IGA suites, ticket-based approvals, and access review campaigns were useful, but they handled process and storage, but not the operator need for fast, explainable control decisions.
- This release made the repo readable as an operational capability rather than a narrow technical demo.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-11

### Shipped
- Cut the first coherent internal version of the product shape behind **workflow-orchestration-studio**.
- Standardized the core objects, decision surfaces, and operator outputs around the repo's main working problem.
- Established the first reviewable version of the architecture described as: React + TypeScript studio for workflow routing, approvals, retries, and operator-facing orchestration visibility

### Notes
- This milestone was less about polish and more about proving the operating model.
- The emphasis was on turning a messy domain problem into something a real team could reason about in CI, review, or day-to-day operations.

## [Prototype] - 2025-08-20

### Built
- Created the first runnable prototype for the repo's core workflow and decision model.
- Started validating the design against real operating pressures instead of idealized sample flows.
- Added enough shape to test whether the project could surface action, not just information.

### Problem pressure
- The prototype phase was shaped by concrete issues such as identity sprawl, least-privilege drift, tenant-boundary mistakes, and approval latency.
- This was the point where the project moved from a sketch into something worth hardening.

## [Design Phase] - 2024-12-17

### Designed
- Defined the core philosophy for the system:
  - operator-first
  - decision-legible
  - CI- and review-friendly
  - suitable for mixed technical and business audiences
- Chose outputs that would make the repo useful to real operators instead of just visually impressive.
- Focused the design on explainability, evidence, and next-best action rather than passive reporting.

### Rejected approaches
- Avoided turning the repo into a generic dashboard or CRUD exercise.
- Avoided thin wrapper patterns that would hide the actual operating problem behind fashionable tooling choices.

## [Idea Origin] - 2024-02-17

### Observed
- The initial idea surfaced while looking at how teams were handling identity sprawl, tenant-boundary risk, and access-review friction.
- The recurring pattern was that people could often see fragments of the problem, but not the whole operational story in one place.

### Insight
- The missing product was not another point solution. It was a clearer operating layer that made the work legible to IAM, platform security, and compliance teams.
- That insight became the basis for **workflow-orchestration-studio**.

## [Background Signals] - 2022-08-09

### Context
- Earlier platform, governance, and operator-tooling work made one pattern obvious: the dangerous systems are rarely the ones with no controls at all. They are the ones where controls exist, but are fragmented, weakly owned, and hard to read under pressure.
- That pattern shaped this project long before the public repo existed.
